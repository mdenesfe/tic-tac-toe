The function bosluk returns True if the given position is empty, and False otherwise. The function kazanma_durumu returns True if the player with the given letter has won the game, and False otherwise. The function beraberlik_kontrol returns True if the game is a draw (i.e., the board is full and no player has won), and False otherwise.
